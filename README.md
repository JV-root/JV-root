## Hello People 👋


I am JV, 21 years old, currently living in São Paulo, Brazil.

Since I was a kid I've always been fascinated by technology and computers spending lots of time on the computer. 
This early interest sparked my love, for everything related to computing. Motivated me to strive to become an expert, in the field.
